      </p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <h4>For the Fish:</h4>
      <ul>
         <li>7 tablespoons all-purpose flour, divided</li>
         <li>7 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
         <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
         <li>sea salt, to taste</li>
         <li>1 pinch freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
         <li>1/3 cup dark beer, cold</li>
         <li>1/3 cup sparkling water, cold</li>
         <li>4 (7-ounce) cod fillets</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>For the Chips</h4>
      <ul>
         <li>2 pounds potatoes, peeled</li>
         <li>1 quart vegetable oil, for frying</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
         <li>Gather the Ingredients</li>
         <li>Set aside 2 tablespoons of flour. In a large, roomy bowl, mix the remaining flour with the cornstarch and
            baking powder. Season lightly with tiny pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
         <li>Using a fork to whisk continuously, add the beer and the sparkling water to the flour mixture and continue
            mixing until you have a thick, smooth batter. Place the batter in the fridge to rest for between 30 minutes
            and 1 hour.</li>
         <li>Meanwhile, cut the potatoes into a little less than 1/2-inch-thick slices, then slice these into
            1/2-inch-wide ships. Place the chips into a colander and rinse under cold running water.</li>
         <li>Place the washed chips into a pan of cold water. Bring to a gentle boil and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
         <li>Drain carefully through a colander, then dry with paper towels. Keep in the fridge covered with paper
            towels until needed.</li>
         <li>Meanwhile, lay the cod fillets on a paper towel and pat dry. Season lightly with a little sea salt.</li>
         <li>Heat the oil to 350 F in a deep-fat fryer or large, deep saucepan. Cook the chips a few handfuls at a time
            in the fat for about 2 minutes. Do not brown them. Once the chips are slightly cooked, remove them from the
            fat and drain. Keep to one side.</li>
         <li>Place the 2 tablespoons of flour reserved from the batter mix into a shallow bowl. Toss each cod fillet in
            the flour and shake off the excess.</li>
         <li>Dip into the batter, coating the entire fillet.</li>
         <li>Check that the oil temperature is still 350 F. Carefully lower each fillet into the hot oil. Fry for
            approximately 8 minutes, or until the batter is crips and golden, turning the fillets from time to time with
            a large slotted spoon.</li>
         <li>Once cooked, remove the fillets from the hot oil and drain on paper towels. Sprinkle with salt. Cover with
            greaseproof paper (parchment paper) and keep hot.</li>
         <li>Heat the oil to 400 F, then cook the chips until golden and crisp, or about 5 minutes. Remove from the oil
            and drain. Season with salt.</li>
         <li>Serve immediately with the hot fish accompanied by your favorite condiment.</li>
      </ol>
